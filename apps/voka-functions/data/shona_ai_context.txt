Shona Grammar and Vocabulary Notes:

Key Rules:
- These lessons are designed for those who wish to learn Shona as a second language.
- This i- occurs if the verb root does not contain a vowel (e.g., -by-, -nw-, -p-, -w-, etc.).
- I am learning Shona at school.
- As in English, a present tense verb in Shona can be used with a future significance.
- This is because the verb root indicates the entering into a state rather than being in a state.
- There are six verb roots which also have a special form in the stative.
- Here the possessive prefix is L in tone and the tone of the noun does not change.
- Here the possessive prefix is L in tone and the demonstrative becomes HL.
- The possessive prefix can also be added to infinitives and participials.
- The possessive prefix is L in tone.
- If the verb root has vy as the final consonant, the v is changed to h before the w.
- To express greater intensity, -isis- or -eses- is suffixed to the verb root.
- The reversive verbal extension “undoes” the action of the verb in its basic stem.
